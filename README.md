# M2-embedded_Remote-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor

This project introduces a temperature and humidity monitoring/sending system, which is based on digital technology and computer technology. The system overcomes disadvantages of poor linearity, low accuracy transmission complex use of traditional system with the analog humidity sensor and makes measurement for temperature and humiture higher precision.
